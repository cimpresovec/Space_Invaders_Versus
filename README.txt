Space Invaders Versus
A game by Luka Horvat (redreaper132(at)gmail.com)
---------------------

Space Invaders was my first real game project back in 2009.
It's a clone of the original with 2 player mode and some added twists and powers.

---------------------

Needs SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf and probably SDL_image to compile. No OpenGL.

---------------------

I don't recomment anyone using this code, I just put it up here for me. The code is bad and
there are memory leaks.
